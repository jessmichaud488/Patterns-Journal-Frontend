<h2>USE CASE</h2>
<p>Inspired by a friend who was working through a difficult time with their mental health, I wanted to create an app that would allow you to be able to keep track of your emotions and sleep so that these patterns and any changes can be communicated more clearly to a mental health professional.</p>

<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>Easily record thoughts, mood, emotional intensity and sleep on the go.Simply sign up and start jotting or browse through older entries to investigate mood and sleep pattern changes.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Securely sign up for an account</li>
<li>Securely log into an account</li>
<li>Create a new journal entry</li>
<li>Update a journal entry</li>
<li>Delete a journal entry</li>
<li>Record sleep, emotional intensity, and mood within entry</li>
<li>Save all entries and have the ability to browse through past entries</li>
</ul>
